Florincoin webapp
=========

The webapp interacts with the instance of Florincoin wallet on being run on the machine. It is useful for the users who want to access the wallet remotely but do not want to make RPC calls directly to the wallet, for security reasons.

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
